This is the GNU cflow package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or GIT version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet.
If you are taking source from Git, you will need to have several
special tools to help contribute.  See the file README-hacking for more
information.  See chapter `Building' for the detailed instructions on
how to build the package.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete. The git lot is the authoritative documentation of
all recent changes. You may convert it to a traditional ChangeLog by
running `make ChangeLog'.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the GIT repository:

To clone the GNU cflow repository, issue the following command:

  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/cflow.git

or

  git clone http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/cflow.git

This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact the mailing list.

For more information about Git access, visit
http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=cflow

* Building

Usual procedures apply:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See INSTALL and README for the detailed instructions.

* Debugging

To enable additional debugging information, configure the package with
--enable-debug option.

Sometimes it is impossible or inconvenient to start cflow from the
debugger. In this case, use --HANG option. The option instructs the
program to sleep for a given number of seconds (3600 by default)
right after startup. For example, run:

	cflow --HANG [OTHER-OPTIONS]

Then switch to another terminal, get the PID of the ivoked utility
and attach to it using gdb:

	gdb cflow PID

Once in gdb, issue the following command

	set _argp_hang=0

Now set your breakpoints and proceed as usual.
