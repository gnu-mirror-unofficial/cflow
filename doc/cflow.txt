    NAME

     cflow - generate a C-language flowgraph (DEVELOPMENT)

    SYNOPSIS

     cflow [-r][-d num][-D name[=def]] ... [-i incl][-I dir] ...
           [-U dir] ... file ...

    DESCRIPTION

     The cflow utility shall analyze a collection of object files or
     assembler, C-language, lex, or yacc source files, and attempt to
     build a graph, written to standard output, charting the external
     references.

    OPTIONS

     The cflow utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
     IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines,
     except that the order of the -D, -I, and -U options (which are
     identical to their interpretation by c99) is significant.

     The following options shall be supported:
   -d  num
          Indicate the depth at which the flowgraph is cut off. The
          application shall ensure that the argument num is a decimal
          integer. By default this is a very large number (typically
          greater than 32000). Attempts to set the cut-off depth to a
          non-positive integer shall be ignored.
   -i  incl
          Increase the number of included symbols. The incl
          option-argument is one of the following characters:
        x
               Include external and static data symbols. The default
               shall be to include only functions in the flowgraph.
        _
               (Underscore) Include names that begin with an underscore.
               The default shall be to exclude these functions (and data
               if -i x is used).
   -r
          Reverse the caller:callee relationship, producing an inverted
          listing showing the callers of each function. The listing shall
          also be sorted in lexicographical order by callee.

    OPERANDS

     The following operand is supported:
   file
          The pathname of a file for which a graph is to be generated.
          Filenames suffixed by .l shall shall be taken to be lex input,
          .y as yacc input, .c as c99 input, and .i as the output of c99
          -E. Such files shall be processed as appropriate, determined by
          their suffix.
          Files suffixed by .s (conventionally assembler source) may have
          more limited information extracted from them.

    STDIN

     Not used.

    INPUT FILES

     The input files shall be object files or assembler, C-language,
     lex, or yacc source files.

    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

     The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
     cflow:
   LANG
          Provide a default value for the internationalization variables
          that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
          IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization
          Variables for the precedence of internationalization variables
          used to determine the values of locale categories.)
   LC_ALL
          If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all
          the other internationalization variables.
   LC_COLLATE
          Determine the locale for the ordering of the output when the -r
          option is used.
   LC_CTYPE
          Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
          bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
          opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
   LC_MESSAGES
          Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
          and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
   NLSPATH
          Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
          of LC_MESSAGES .

    ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

     Default.

    STDOUT

     The flowgraph written to standard output shall be formatted as
     follows:
"%d %s:%s\n", <reference number>, <global>, <definition>

     Each line of output begins with a reference (that is, line) number,
     followed by indentation of at least one column position per level.
     This is followed by the name of the global, a colon, and its
     definition. Normally globals are only functions not defined as an
     external or beginning with an underscore; see the OPTIONS section
     for the -i inclusion option. For information extracted from
     C-language source, the definition consists of an abstract type
     declaration (for example, char *) and, delimited by angle brackets,
     the name of the source file and the line number where the
     definition was found. Definitions extracted from object files
     indicate the filename and location counter under which the symbol
     appeared (for example, text).

     Once a definition of a name has been written, subsequent references
     to that name contain only the reference number of the line where
     the definition can be found. For undefined references, only "<>"
     shall be written.

    STDERR

     The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

    OUTPUT FILES

     None.

    EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

     None.

    EXIT STATUS

     The following exit values shall be returned:
    0
          Successful completion.
   >0
          An error occurred.

    CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

     Default.
     _________________________________________________________________

   The following sections are informative.

    APPLICATION USAGE

     Files produced by lex and yacc cause the reordering of line number
     declarations, and this can confuse cflow. To obtain proper results,
     the input of yacc or lex must be directed to cflow.

    EXAMPLES

     Given the following in file.c:
int i;
int f();
int g();
int h();
int
main()
{
    f();
    g();
    f();
}
int
f()
{
    i = h();
}

     The command:
cflow -i x file.c

     produces the output:
1 main: int(), <file.c 6>
2    f: int(), <file.c 13>
3        h: <>
4        i: int, <file.c 1>
5    g: <>

    RATIONALE

     None.

    FUTURE DIRECTIONS

     None.
